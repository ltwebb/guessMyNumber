## Project Source
 - Built on from a project started on Udemy 'The Complete Javascript Course' 
## Confetti 
- https://github.com/catdad/canvas-confetti
- For this small project I used the CDN at <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/canvas-confetti@1.4.0/dist/confetti.browser.min.js"></script>
but for a larger project I would use the package from npm npm install --save canvas-confetti
- lots of great code snips on https://www.kirilv.com/canvas-confetti/
 - add CDN to html under .js
 - add snip to js file in the if statment for winning
 - adjust the fall, size, rate of confetti that you would need for your project.
