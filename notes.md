# Simple Guess My Number Game built with HTML, JS, Canvas Confetti and TailwindCSS

## Project Source
 - I jazzed up a tutorial I was following from the Udemy course 'The Complete Javascript Course'. 

## Canvas Confetti 
- I pulled in the confetti feature from [Canvas Confetti](https://github.com/catdad/canvas-confetti)...because I may have a confetti problem.
- For this small project, I used the CDN script (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/canvas-confetti@1.4.0/dist/confetti.browser.min.js`),
but for a larger project I would use the package from npm npm install --save canvas-confetti
- I found lots of great code snips and examples on https://www.kirilv.com/canvas-confetti/

## Steps to implement Canvas Confetti
 1. Put the Canvas Confetti CDN link in HTML file under your link to script.js file.
 2. Add, or write, the code in your script.js file. I just started by copying a basic example from https://www.kirilv.com/canvas-confetti/. 
 3. I wanted it to trigger when a person guessed the correct number, because that should always happen when we get something right...especially when coding. I put it in the 'if(guess === secretNumber)' statement. 
 
## Tailwind CSS
- I removed all original styles and added [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). 
- I only used the CDN because the project was small and style requirements were simple (and I'm trying to get as much experience with Tailwindcss as possible:). 
- I had a design in mind, but then I saw this awesome card design by [devmehdineysi on Tailwindcomponents.com](https://tailwindcomponents.com/component/input-1) and decided to adapt it for this. 

## Graphics
- I cropped some graphics that I found on Pixabay images by [Gustavo Rezende](https://pixabay.com/users/gustavorezende-1488336/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=3171905) from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=3171905)
